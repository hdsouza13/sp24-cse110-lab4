1. What will happen at line 12 and why? The code will print 3. Because the parameter prices has 3 elements, so the loop will stop when i reaches 3.

2. What will happen at line 13 and why? The code will print 150. Because, in the last iteration of the for loop, discountedPrice = 300 * 0.5 = 150.  

3. What will happen at line 14 and why? The code will print 150. Because, in the last iteration of the for loop, finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice*100)/100 = 150. 

4.  What will this function return? The function will return an array of numbers. In this example, the array will be [50, 100, 150] each of the 3 iterations of the for loop adds 50, 100, 150 respectively into the discounted variable. 

5. What will happen at line 12 and why? This is because i is now declared using the 'let' keyword; this means it has block scope and thus attempting to use it outside of the block it was declared throws us an error that it is not defined.

6. What will happen at line 13 and why? We get an error this time. This is because discountedPrice is now declared using the 'let' keyword; this means it has block scope and thus attempting to use it outside of the block it was declared throws us an error that it is not defined.

7. What will happen at line 14 and why? It will print out 150. This is because this line is in the same block as the declaration of the finalPrice variable so no error is thrown.

8. What will this function return? The same as question 4, the function will return an array of numbers. In this example, the array will be [50, 100, 150] each of the 3 iterations of the for loop adds 50, 100, 150 respectively into the discounted variable. 

9. What will happen at line 11 and why? The program will give an error that i is not defined. This is because it was declard using the 'let' keyword and the program is attempting to print it outside of that block.

10. What will happen at line 12 and why? It will print 3, because it prints out the variable length that is constant and was declard in the same block.  

11. What will this function return? The same as question 4 and 8 the function will return an array of numbers. In this example, the array will be [50, 100, 150] each of the 3 iterations of the for loop adds 50, 100, 150 respectively into the discounted variable.
